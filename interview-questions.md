3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: In my experience object-oriented programming is a way to element using a bunch of variables and methods like functional programming. Insteaad of creating variables we create a object to store data and a function inside that way we can make code more dynamic and easier to change the data.
